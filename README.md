# cors-proxy-demo

Welcome to the CORS Proxy Demo powered by cors-anywhere! This project provides a hands-on showcase of circumventing Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictions using the cors-anywhere proxy server. CORS restrictions are browser security features that limit web page scripts from making requests to different domains.

This demo illustrates how cors-anywhere, a versatile Node.js proxy, enables you to seamlessly navigate CORS limitations. Acting as an intermediary, cors-anywhere facilitates cross-origin requests from your client-side JavaScript applications to external APIs or servers, bypassing CORS barriers.

##### Features:

* Effortless Setup: Get started swiftly with straightforward setup instructions. Clone the repository, install dependencies using pnpm install, and launch the proxy server effortlessly.

* Convenient Command: Execute the proxy server with a single command using pnpm run proxy, providing a hassle-free experience for users.

* CORS Evasion: Execute requests from your client-side JavaScript code to external endpoints without being hindered by CORS restrictions.

* Flexibility: Customize the proxy server behavior to fit your specific requirements. The proxy.js file provides a clear entry point for configuring and starting the server.

* Logging Capability: Monitor request and response activity for debugging purposes, thanks to built-in logging functionality.

##### Usage:

1. Clone the repository to your local environment.
2. Ensure Node.js and ```pnpm``` are installed.
3. Install dependencies using ```pnpm install```.
4. Initiate the proxy server by running ```pnpm run proxy``` or ```node proxy.js```.
5. Access the proxy server endpoints in your client-side JavaScript to initiate cross-origin requests effortlessly.


###### _Example_
```javascript
fetch('https://localhost:8080/https://example.com/api/data')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));

```
